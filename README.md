### [Hey! I'm ](https://github.com/troyabraham#hey-im-ethanabraham_xi-ethan-abraham-)[@troyabraham](https://twitter.com/troyabraham) (Troy Abraham) 👋

I'm a cybersecurity researcher from Thiruvalla, Kerala.🐘󠁵󠁳󠁣󠁡󠁿 I currently live in India. 🇮🇳

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems, in Kerala. 🌎

I created [Website Cloner](https://github.com/troyabraham#), [Web Spy](https://github.com/troyabraham#), [Linux Leads](https://github.com/ethanabraham#), [Twitter Bot](https://github.com/ethanabraham#) and a bunch of other open source tools. 🚀

I like to build/break things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. 🤖

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to Hackers Punk, Space AI, and my other open source projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an external consultant. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to [contact me](mailto:infosec@ethanabraham.com). 🤓

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. ☕

This is the place where I opensource stuff and break things 🤣
